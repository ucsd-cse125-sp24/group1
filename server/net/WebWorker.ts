 * Create a fake "server" that can run in a

 * (i.e. a separate thread) in the browser.
 *
 * Since our server is written in JavaScript, we can also run it in the browser.
 * Our game preview on GitHub Pages has no real server to connect to, which
 * makes it hard to preview changes to the server and game logic.
 *
 * With this Web Worker version of the server, if the client fails to connect to
 * the server, it can offer to start a worker that runs the same server code.
 * This is not unlike how Minecraft does singleplayer, hosting a server instance
 * locally in another thread.
 *
 * In the future, we could explore moving this to a service worker so it can
 * control multiple "clients" on different tabs.
