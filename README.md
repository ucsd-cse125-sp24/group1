# UCSD CSE 125 2024 group 1: TBD studios

This is our group's 3D multiplayer video game for [CSE 125](https://cse125.ucsd.edu/). Our team opted to use WebGL to allow the game to run on more devices.

## Development

This project requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/). This should also install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Then, install the dependencies.

```shell
$ npm install
```

To start the server, run

```shell
$ npm start
```

For the client, you can start another server that will automatically re-build the project when you make a change.

```shell
$ npm run dev
```

You can actually build the client files with the following command.

```shell
$ npm run build
```
